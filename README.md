- 👋 Hi, I’m @hittheflash, the name comes like a "spin-off" the song "Hit the road, Jack" from Ray Charles; I love that song.
- 👀 I’m interested in create/code/build projects with real-life solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to become a better person, I know how to code, how to fit models and so on, but it isn't everything.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finance projects, computer vision algos and human teams.
- 📫 How to reach me: [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanpaulpaes/)
